The wheel, the plow. The compass, the telescope. The train, the car, the plane. The light bulb, the telephone, the internet, the smartphone. And so many others. All innovations created or harnessed by humans, for humans—used as tools to explore, discover, and create better lives for ourselves, our families and others. All progress has a starting point.

Artificial intelligence is the most powerful tool humans have ever invented. In just over two years, more than 300 million people around the world have used ChatGPT's freely available intelligence to ideate, discover, and break through beyond what we're currently capable of doing on our own; in January, one in seven American adults used ChatGPT. Most of our users—nearly eight in 10—are under the age of 35.

## The Pace of Progress

Economic research indicates that technologies usually take decades to diffuse across the world. More recently, digital platforms that have come before ChatGPT took between about 10 years (Netflix) and close to one year (Fortnite) to reach 100 million users. ChatGPT hit that milestone in two months, ushering in a new paradigm for the pace of technological progress.
