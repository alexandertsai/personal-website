  The marked decline in the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) across developed countries has
sparked discourse on its far-reaching implications for social structures, labour markets, and
innovation (Bloom et al., 2024; Venis, 2022). Projections suggest this trend will persist, with The
Lancet (2024) forecasting that by 2100, 97% of countries will have sub-replacement fertility.
The potential consequences of the above are starkly imagined in Empty Planet by Bricker and
Ibbitson (2020): global population growth turns negative, resulting in the stagnation of
knowledge and quality of life for a vanishing population. The prospect of potential self-imposed
extinction prompts us to urgently understand the reasons (and potential solutions) behind the
declining TFR, thus presenting a modern challenge.

In this essay, we use loss aversion – the asymmetric experience of losses and gains where
the former is felt more strongly than the latter – to elucidate the cognitive biases experienced by
Singaporean citizens in making fertility choices (Tversky & Kahneman, 1991). Although loss
aversion was originally formulated in consumer choice theory, parallels exist between consumer
choice and fertility choice in weighing potential future gains against immediate or foreseen
losses (Tversky & Kahneman, 1991). Hence, we leverage loss aversion to explain why the
perception of childbearing as a loss plays a significant role in the declining TFR in Singapore.

In Singapore, the TFR has remained consistently below replacement level since 1977,
reaching an average of 0.97 in 2023 (Singapore Department of Statistics, 2024; Yap, 2003). To
understand the impetus behind this decline, we examine data from national family planning and
population surveys in 1973, 1977, and 2021. Our examination reveals that the ideal number of
children (INOC) has decreased from 3.4 in 1973 to 2.7 in 1977 and to 2.2 in 2021 (Chen et al.,
1979; Kee & Saw, 1975; National Population and Talent Division, 2022). This trend indicates
Singaporeans are finding childbearing less and less desirable. We connect this shift to findings
from Balcetis and Dunning (2009), who suggest that diminished desirability negatively affects
how individuals process information. Further research affirms and contextualises this
relationship, showing a negative correlation between one’s INOC and attitude towards
childbearing (Brase, 2016; Brauner-Otto, 2012). We conclude that Singaporeans possess a
predominantly negative attitude towards childbearing, perceiving it as a loss rather than a gain.
For instance, Singaporeans would emphasise the financial costs and the deceleration in one’s
career over any potential fulfilment children may bring (Institute of Policy Studies, 2013).
Hence, under the principles of loss aversion, the perception of childbearing as a “loss” rather
than a “gain” would elicit a large bias towards not having children, thereby significantly
influencing the TFR.

Since 1987, the Singaporean government has introduced numerous pro-natalist policies,
many of which yielded limited success (Jones & Hamid, 2015; Tan, 2023). This essay suggests
policymakers should account for loss aversion when presenting childbearing incentives. For
example, during Budget 2025, financial incentives were framed as mitigating the “loss” of
having many children (Ministry of Finance, 2025). To enhance effectiveness, these initiatives
could be reframed to present the “gain” of having many children by viewing them as investments
for one’s future. Policies presenting childbearing in terms of benefits rather than costs would
mitigate loss aversion and play a role in ameliorating TFR trends.
