  ### Thoughts
  
  Despite the author's note stating that the descriptive part of his experience as a POW wasn't the focus of the book, I oddly
  found that aspect much more interesting than the latter half that focused on the pscyhological coping mechanisms. Perhaps it's to
  do with how I feel in some ways a singular concept is almost over-explained or over-analysed in some ways.

  Regardless, I deeply resonate with the core message of the book. I remember the first time I chanced upon the quote by Nietzsche was in
  junior college when my general paper (english) teacher showed it to us in class. "He who has a *why* can bear any *how*". While I don't
  think this quote has directly helped me overcome any hardships, it's been helpful in rationalising different aspects of my life â€” times when
  I was feeling motivated and times were I wasn't so much.

  I think a lot of people severely underestimate the sheer importance of a sense of purpose. Someone told me recently that happiness is not the end goal,
  but rather just a byproduct of purpose. I don't think I agree with that completely but I get where they come from. This made me think
  of another conversation I've had recently. It went along these lines:  

  "I tried to retire last year but I just couldn't."  

  "Why? They pay you too much?"  
  
  "No well I just can't imagine what I would do? What would I do with myself if it wasn't work?"
