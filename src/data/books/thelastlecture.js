  ## Summary
  
  The Last Lecture is based on Randy Pausch, a CS professor at CMU. After being diagnosed with terminal cancer he delivers a lecture titled "Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams."
  It's a compilation of his life lessons â€” to work harder, be earnest, listen to feedback etc.
  
  ## Key Message
  
  Family is really important. Despite the discussion about achieving his dreams of working at disney or floating in space,
   you can tell that somewhere in Randy's mind, his family is still a large part of his life. He wants them to succeed and learn from him... perhaps even surpass him.
   I find it a bit sad that dying people almost always start talking about their family near the end.
  
  ## Learnings
  
  My friend had recommended this book to me on the premise that Randy Pausch was a HCI professor. I can't really say that I learnt anything about HCI specifically, but I enjoyed
   delving into the mind of a person who teaches HCI and understanding all the idiosyncracies behind it. I recall Randy once mentioning he would almost always hire someone if they
   were an eagle scout (a high-ranked boy scout). He explained that it showed discipline. My takeaway: while not everybody will appreciate something you achieved, especially if it
   isn't directly related to your line of work, there will probably be someone out there who admires it.
  
  ## Final Verdict
  
  It's okay. This would probaby be the 6th book that I recommend to my friends.
